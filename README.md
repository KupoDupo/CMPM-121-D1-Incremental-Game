# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to remove _this_ content from their README.md file and replace it with their own project documentation.

## Commands

Run deno task dev to open up local web view of project.

## Credits

I took inspiration from <https://github.com/ivli18/CMPM121-D1> for the circular backdrop behind my carrot so it more obviously looks like a button that users should be pressing.
